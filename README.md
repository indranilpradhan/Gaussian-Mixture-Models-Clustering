# Gaussian-Mixture-Models-Clustering

1. You are given 3 data files(dataset1.pkl,dataset2.pkl,dataset3.pkl) and 1 code file
gmm.py. The code consists of -
(a) Function to load dataset.
(b) Function to save dataset.
(c) Class GMM1D which consists multiple functions.
2. Load dataset .
3. Use inbuilt sklearn functions to cluster(GMM clustering) the points and plot them.
Also report no of iterations taken to converge.
4. In GMM1D, fill in the blanks with code and cluster the points. Plot for each
iteration.
